# Fency

Fency is a web extension which will inject JavaScript to various pages to improve the experience with those pages.
You can enable/disable JavaScripts that will be injected via the popup menu.

The focus is on baked-in scripts for web applications used by InWork for now.
In a future version we hope to allow users to add their own scripts to further personalize the experience.

Use the Git Bash shell and enter the command

web-ext run -t chromium
